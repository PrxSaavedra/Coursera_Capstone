Introduction

Madrid is a big economic city, but also one of main tourism destination in Spain, a tourist country. In this context, our client wants 
to open a restaurant. Since he just came from travelling India and there are not many Indian restaurants in Madrid and they tend to be
concentrated in some areas, he wants to explore the possibility or opening an Indian restaurant in an area with no Indian restaurants or 
as few as possible.

Business problem

There are two main problems to face in such situation:
1.- Build an Indian eating option that is diverse from traditional. Such is a business model issue for which our client has hired a 
professional.
2.- Determine the place where this new offer will be placed. For that we have been hired. We need to determine other Indian offers in 
the area, but also sources of clientele, should it be local (by being near universities, offices, etc) or foreign (by being near tourist 
attractions).
